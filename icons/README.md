# Icons Folder

This folder is prepared for future custom icon functionality in the TSE Demo Builder system. **Custom icon support is coming soon!**

## Future Purpose

When custom icon support is implemented, this folder will:

- Store user-uploaded custom icons for menu items
- Provide a centralized location for icon management
- Support various icon formats (PNG, SVG, etc.)
- Enable personalized demo experiences with custom branding

## Planned Features

- **Icon Upload**: Users will be able to upload custom icons for their demo menus
- **Icon Management**: Browse, organize, and manage uploaded icons
- **Icon Preview**: Preview icons before applying them to menu items
- **Icon Categories**: Organize icons by type, industry, or use case

## Current Status

This folder is currently empty and prepared for future functionality. The TSE Demo Builder currently uses:
- Built-in system icons
- Emoji-based icons
- Default icon sets

## Contributing

When custom icon support becomes available:
- Upload icons in supported formats (PNG, SVG recommended)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include appropriate metadata
- Follow icon design guidelines for consistency

## Stay Tuned

Custom icon functionality is in development. Check the main repository README for updates on feature availability.
